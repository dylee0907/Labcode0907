Master engineer to be in the HOUSSSSSSSSSE!!
Wassup everyone! 
I am a engineering student here in Korea attending Kyunghee Uni studying EE for BD(I do have thought on going for MD)
I finally made my page and will be uploading Verilog HDL, python, C++ and C codes!
Glad to be a member of github finally and cant wait to see my page extend over time.
I have interests in Machine learning, Block-chain tech and most of all digital circuit design.
If you have any regards related to my codes let me know through my email jjh1304444@naver.com and ill make some changes recommanded.
Keep in touch everyone.
Lee over and out!
